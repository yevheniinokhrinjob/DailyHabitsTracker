# DailyHabitsTracker
This is a test project I'm building to practice backend development and improve my Spring ecosystem skills. The idea is to create a simple application where users can define daily habits (e.g., "drink water", "read 30 minutes") and log their completion. Users also earn points and can redeem rewards.
